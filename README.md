## Description

I was presented with the following coding exercise during a job application. As it involved a bit more work than the average test, I wanted to keep track of it.

# Build a spaceship

You are an up-and-coming intergalactic trader. You want to start building your fleet of logistic vessels. Given that some solar systems are not entirely friendly, your ship needs to have defense capabilities as well.

A functioning ship needs the following:  

Engine  
Fuselage  
20 units of Ammo  
Weapons system  
Navigation system  
5 units of shields    

Your currency portfolio looks as below:

CURA - 20000  
CURB - 200  
CURC - 5000  

Each market can offer goods and services but only in that currency.

### Market A - accepts currency A

It then offers goods and services denominated in Currency A.

shields - 20 CURA

ammo - 4 CURA

1 CURB - 50 CURA

### Market B - accepts Currency B

shields - 20 CURB

ammo - 4 CURB

Engine - 20 CURB

Ship Fuselage  - 5 CURB

Weapon system - 10 CURB

CURC - 0.8 CURB

CURA - 0.025 CURB

### Market C accepts Currency C

Shields - 20 CURC

Engine - 25 CURC

Ammo - 8 CURC

Navigation System - 5 CURC

Weapon system - 20 CURC

CURB - 1.2 CURC    

#### Assuming the costs for shipping and assembly are zero, figure out the most optimal strategy to build a ship.
